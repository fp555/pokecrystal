# Pokémon Crystal [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is my romhack of Pokémon Crystal. It's still in early alpha, so all the changes I want to make are not yet implemented.

## How to play
Starting from **v0.14** my romhack is available as a BPS patch. Download it from the [Releases page][latest-release], then use [RomPatcher.js][rompatcher] (or any other program that supports BPS patches) to apply it on top of your retail *Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0)* ROM.
> [!WARNING]
> The correct base ROM has this SHA1 hash: `f4cd194bdee0d04ca4eac29e09b8e4e9d818c133`

### Build it yourself
Clone this repository, or download one of the tarballs from the [Releases page][latest-release], and follow [these instructions][install].

You can clone the [upstream repository][upstream] to build a retail ROM with the correct hash.
